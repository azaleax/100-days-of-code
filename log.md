# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 10, 2018 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Wrote function for r/dailyprogrammer challenge \#362

**Thoughts:** Writing the code took longer than expected. The challenge is still not done and needs to be worked on more. Cleanup and full implementation still pending.

**Tomorrow's Todo**: Clean up the logic for looping through the encode logic and make it more generic.

### Day 1: June 11, 2018 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Continued to polish the r/dailyprogrammer challenge \#362

**Thoughts:** This challenge has been trickier than I initially thought. Yesterday's implementation was fairly hard-coded and ugly. Tried to beautify it more today.

**Tomorrow's Todo**: Continue with logic cleanup and code cleanup

### Day 2: June 12, 2018 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Finished the r/dailyprogrammer challenge \#362

**Thoughts:** Cleaned up and finished the challenge. Need to keep at challenges to improve thought process to speed up implementation.

**Tomorrow's Todo**: Look into other challenges or start on a project.
