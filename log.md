# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 10, 2018 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Wrote function for r/dailyprogrammer challenge \#362

**Thoughts:** Writing the code took longer than expected. The challenge is still not done and needs to be worked on more. Cleanup and full implementation still pending.

**Tomorrow's TODO**: Clean up the logic for looping through the encode logic and make it more generic.
